# Micro-frontend Initializer

This project requires following:

iterm2: https://iterm2.com/

nvm: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

jq: https://stedolan.github.io/jq

- In an iterm window:
- Edit `defaultApps.sh` file with the JSON keys of the apps you like to run. (refer: `repos.json`)
- Run `bash start.sh` to run all default apps.

You can also run only the apps you'd like by using bash arguments.

ie: `bash start.sh root meal`
